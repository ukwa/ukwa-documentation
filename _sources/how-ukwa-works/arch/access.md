# Access Services

Combining the WARCs and logs with metadata from curators, we offer various types of access.

#### Playback

The primary access mode is via a Playback service. This relies on readers knowing which URLs they wish to access, and a Content Index (or CDX) service is used to look up which WARC records hold copies of each URL, and from what times.

#### Browse & Search

We take a range of steps to provide useful access to our collections for users who do not know which specific URLs they need. We use W3ACT to gather archived material into a set of browsable collections, and create a full-text index so the contents of the archive can be searched. This index can also be used to explore trends and perform some basic analyses.

#### Datasets, Statistical Reports & APIs

We also work with researchers to provide data sets that summarise some factual aspects of the archived resources. For example, in the past we have processed our WARCs to analyse links between web sites, and how they change over time. The same infrastructure can be used to generate statistical reports.

Where appropriate, we also offer API access to information that it better queried than downloaded. For example our Playback service offers the Memento API, which allows others to query our holdings without downloading some massive dataset.
