# Datasets

We have a number of different web archive collections, defined by the terms under which the material was collected. We treat each as a dataset in it's own right, and use the collection to gather any data extracted from each one.

Since 2020 the [British Library Shared Research Repository](https://bl.iro.bl.uk/collections/d09fbc16-7a76-49db-a45f-16a99c30ae3e) has taken on the role of holding and distributing the datasets and their metadata. This part of this site focuses on providing further information about the data available there.
